Gain insights on the time you spend online! Loggy logs the time you spend on
each website to beautifully give you insights on your internet habits when
needed.

## Architecture

The plugin is built using JavaScript, Vue, and sprinkles of Tailwind. This setup is
backed by Webpack to bundle the JavaScript and Vue templates into redistributable output files
that are ready to bundle into the extension xpi. Tailwind is compiled using
PostCSS in the Webpack pipeline.

## Getting Started

Install the addon from the [Mozilla Addons Store](https://addons.mozilla.org)
and it'll start logging right away! If you wish to view your logs go to the addon's options.
