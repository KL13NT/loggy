Gain insights on the time you spend online! Loggy logs the time you spend on
each website to beautifully give you insights on your internet habits when
needed.

## Architecture

The plugin is built using JavaScript, Vue, and sprinkles of Tailwind. This setup is
backed by Webpack to bundle the JavaScript and Vue templates into redistributable output files
that are ready to bundle into the extension xpi. Tailwind is compiled using
PostCSS in the Webpack pipeline.

## Permissions Breakdown
Loggy requires very few permissions to work. These permissions relate to storing
your history and monitoring the tabs you open/close.

- Store unlimited amount of client-side data (`storage`, `unlimitedStorage`) is used for storing
  website data. Its size is based on the number of websites you visit and how
  long you spend on each so I had to use `unlimitedStorage` for it.
- Access browser tabs (`tabs`) is used to get metadata about visited websites.
  This permission cannot, in any way, grant access to your private data such as cookies.

## Getting Started

and it'll start logging right away!

#### Browser Action

Upon installation the extension will show up in your browser's toolbar. Clicking
it will show a popup with the top 5 websites you visited today alongside an
approximation of the total time you spent browsing.

Clicking the `Visit full history` link in the browser action will take you to
the full log that contains all websites since you installed the extension.
You'll be able to search and sort the log.
